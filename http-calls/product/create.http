{"id": 1, "title": "Coffee Nespresso | COCOA KISS", "description": "Dark and bitter cocoa flavour meets the malted cereal note of the base espresso in BARISTA CREATIONS Cocoa Truffle. It’s rich and reminiscent of dark chocolate truffles. The base espresso is a blend of the finest South American Arabicas – sweet Bourbon beans from Brazil in harmony with the washed Colombian beans. A split roast brings out the best in each to create an incredibly smooth and rounded espresso – a great match for that dark cocoa flavour. A distinct cocoa note with a touch of almond sweetness and a hint of vanilla – that’s how you’ll recognize a BARISTA CREATIONS Cocoa Truffle cappuccino.", "link": "https://www.nespresso.com/es/en/order/capsules/original/cocoa-truffle-coffee-capsule", "image": "https://www.nespresso.com/shared_res/mos/free_html/int/barista-flavoured/coffee-pdp/img/cocoa-truffe/capsule_cocoa_OL_L.png","barcode": "1234567890Z","category_ids": [1],"categories": [{"id": 1, "title": "Drinks"}],"list_id": 1, "list": {"id": 1, "title": "Pantry"}}
